# PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
a = 5
b = 10

# Arithmetic Operators
print(a + b) # Addition
print(a - b) # Subtraction
print(a * b) # Multiplication
print(a / b) # Division
print(a // b) # Floor Division
print(a % b) # Modulus
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b) # Equal
print(a != b) # Not Equal
print(a > b) # Greater Than
print(a < b) # Less Than
print(a >= b) # Greater Than or Equal To
print(a <= b) # Less Than or Equal To
